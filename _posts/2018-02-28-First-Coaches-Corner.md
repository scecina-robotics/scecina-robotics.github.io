## Tagging ##
Tagging was added to our website this week using the technique found
[here](http://longqian.me/2017/02/09/github-jekyll-tag/).

## This Week (3/1/2018) ##

Here is a list of things I hope we can accomplish this week:

![code icon](/images/icons/code.png){:height="50px" width="50px"}

Create PROs project for Involution bot using "Subsystem Module Methodology"
as found in the [PROs Clawbot Tutorial](https://pros.cs.purdue.edu/tutorials/clawbot/)
creating a different file for each component : base, dropper, trough(?), scoop.

![dropper icon](/images/icons/dropper.png){:height="50px" width="50px"}
![trough icon](/images/icons/trough.png){:height="50px" width="50px"}

Begin working on trough and dropper components.

Question to ask: Do they need to be separate components or one line feed component?

**Also, if there is time, I would still like to test all Cortex units.**
