Today, a Saturday, we had an impromptu meeting to finish up our robot so we can use our Thursday meeting to test the robot and train 
the drivers. The team has improved significantly, as we have developed a grasp of the resources available to us. Tonight, Scecina is 
hosting its prom, but no one on our team will be attending due to the fact that only one member of our team is old enough. We try to 
come off as not bummed out about that, so we're going to pretend that we've created the superior event.

Out robot has come together entirely and has been rudimentarily coded. A new part has been added to aid in the efficiency of the scoop: 
the gate. This will prevent collected raquetballs from falling out of the scoop once they have been collected, as well as allowing the 
scoop to function without the use of the arena walls.

As our previous robot turned out to be a failure of insurpassable proportions, this new robot may be a demonstration of our team's newfound 
familiarity with VEX Roboticsâ„¢ parts and capacity to problem solve. In the time since we first came together, our team has blossomed from 
a group of bumbling fools to a true team that collaborates to meet and exceed our expectations. Our robot design may not be the greatest 
ever created, but it is a testament to our growth. May the best robot win!
