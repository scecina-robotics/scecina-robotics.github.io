It has been over a month since our last post, and although it is highly unlikely that anyone is actually reading these, 
we would like to apologize for our absence. Our robot has made significant progress and is nearing completion. We have 
had to make slight modifications to the initial design due to measurement restrictions and other functional issues, but 
the basic idea remains unchanged. Our competition will be held on Saturday, April 28 from 9 AM to 2 PM at Scecina.

We hope to make our updates more routine in the future, and I, Aleks, have taken responsibility to make sure the blog is 
updated and well managed. To the likely nonexistant reader, thank you for your patience.
