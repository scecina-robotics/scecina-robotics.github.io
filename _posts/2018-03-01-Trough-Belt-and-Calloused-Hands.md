Progress was made in the design of the trough. It was decided to go with a
conveyor belt type of system. This make the dropper a much easier component.

A code repo was started which includes structure to split the component
code into individual files.

There was also a lot of organizing of belt pieces resulting in at least
one calloused hand. We are all hopeful for a full recovery by next week.
:smile:.
