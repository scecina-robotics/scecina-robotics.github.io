The group of campers have made substantial progress on their robots, working together in their groups to improve and correct for issues. 
The organization with which this week began has been slowly destroyed to the point that groups have been interchanging materials and tools, 
but the general chemistry of the campers has certainly improved. We have had the opportunity to introduce the campers to VEX Robotics and 
the programs we use to code the robots we build.

Most of our games and challenges have revolved around the usage of sensors. A game of tag used touch sensors to "tag" the other robots and 
the use of a sonic sensors allowed our robots to approach objects in a maze without striking them.

The code the campers have used is predominantly prefabricated by Mr. Smith, but his instruction has led the students to begin to understand 
the process.

We have great hopes for the rest of the camps and the use of all of the information they have learned, as our final challenge creates a 
situation in which the teams must use all of what they have learned.
