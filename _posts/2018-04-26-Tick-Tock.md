This upcoming Saturday, April 28, our robotics team will compete against South Putnam High School in the "Involution" competition. 
The competition will be informal, but the rapidly approaching date has sent our group into a state of frenzy. Our robot is 
functionally complete, but requires a few modiications to increase efficiency and to avoid potential problems.

The competition will be held from 9 AM to 2 PM in rm. 003. We hope to see you there!
