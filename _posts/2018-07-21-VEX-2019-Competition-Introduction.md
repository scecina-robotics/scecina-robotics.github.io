We reviewed the competition for the 2018-19 school year and have begun to theorize about our robot design. Because we cannot be in the lab 
consistantly during the summer, we will be working with theoretical designs until the school year begins. The program Inventor and Google 
drive will be our main avenues of collaboration for this period.

The Inventor program can be found [here](https://www.autodesk.com/education/free-software/inventor-professional).
