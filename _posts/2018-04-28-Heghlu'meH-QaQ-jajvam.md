"Today is a good day to die," the title of today's post means. A traditional Klingon statement before entering into battle. 
Today, we charged into battle against South Putnam High School in the Involution competition, and even though we lost by 
a significant margin, we enjoyed our day and our time with the other team. Although no one died at our competition today, 
the spirit of the phrase conveys the eagerness and relentlessness with which we approached this game, as well as my own 
personal inclination toward Star Trek. 

The competition was a display of teamwork and communication, which our team continues to lack, and a chance for growth. We may 
not have won, but the winning is arbitrary, meaningless; this competition was a success because it was enjoyable for all 
parties involved (except maybe Anthony) and gave both of our rudimentary teams a chance to exercise our limited expertise and 
grow. The robot may have fallen over multiple times, but through this it taught us to create a less top-heavy design.

We look forward to the future and what it has to bring for this club, and if today was any indication, that future is bright.
