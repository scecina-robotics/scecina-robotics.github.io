Today, we began a new project: building a robot to compete against South Putnam High School in the game of [Involution](/pdfs/involution_game.pdf). Below, we have included a table  that encompasses the four major components that we anticipate using in our design with an associated icon.

Component | Icon
----------|------
Base | ![base icon](/images/icons/base.png){:height="50px" width="50px"}
Dropper | ![dropper icon](/images/icons/dropper.png){:height="50px" width="50px"}
Trough | ![trough icon](/images/icons/trough.png){:height="50px" width="50px"}
Scoop |![scoop icon](/images/icons/scoop.png){:height="50px" width="50px"}
Code | ![code icon](/images/icons/code.png){:height="50px" width="50px"}

Here is a snap shot of our brainstorming session.
