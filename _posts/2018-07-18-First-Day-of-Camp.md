"It's going well, I guess. People are actually doing stuff. It's surprising." -Phil Kozenski

We have began a four day camp for sixth through eight graders to gain an introduction into VEX Robotics and the processes by which robot 
coding occurs. Today, we are building our minibots and beginning calibration for later code. The teams are working well together and making 
substantial progress on their assignments.

We have high hopes for the rest of this camp and the students participating in it.
